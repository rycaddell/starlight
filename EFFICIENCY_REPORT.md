## Issue #1: Unnecessary Polling in Audio Recording Hook ⚠️ HIGH IMPACT

**Status:** ✅ FIXED IN THIS PR

**Location:** `hooks/useAudioRecording.tsx` lines 143-166

**Problem:**
The audio recording hook uses `setInterval` to poll `recording.getStatusAsync()` every second while recording is active. This creates 60 unnecessary async API calls per minute during recording sessions.

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  let interval: NodeJS.Timeout;
  if (recording && isRecording && !isPaused) {
    interval = setInterval(async () => {
      if (recording) {
        const status = await recording.getStatusAsync();
        setRecordingDuration(Math.floor(status.durationMillis / 1000));
        // ... check 8-minute limit
      }
    }, 1000);
  }
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [recording, isRecording, isPaused]);
```

**Impact:**
- 60 async API calls per minute during recording
- Unnecessary overhead and potential battery drain on mobile devices
- Polling is an anti-pattern when event-driven alternatives exist

**Solution:**
Replace polling with expo-av's built-in `setOnRecordingStatusUpdate()` callback mechanism, which fires events when recording status changes. This eliminates all polling overhead while maintaining the same functionality.

**Performance Gain:**
- Reduces API calls from 60/minute to 0 (event-driven)
- More efficient battery usage
- Better follows React Native best practices

## Issue #2: Multiple String Replacements in Mirror Generation

**Location:** `lib/supabase/mirrors.js` lines 119-123

**Problem:**
The OpenAI response cleaning uses chained `.replace()` operations, creating intermediate string objects:

```javascript
const cleanedContent = rawContent
  .replace(/```json\n?/g, '')
  .replace(/```\n?/g, '')
  .trim();
```

**Impact:**
- Creates 2 intermediate string objects
- Minor memory inefficiency during mirror generation
- Not a critical issue but can be optimized

**Suggested Solution:**
Use a single regex pattern or better parsing approach:

```javascript
const cleanedContent = rawContent.replace(/```(json)?\n?/g, '').trim();
```

**Performance Gain:** Minor - reduces string allocations by 50%

## Issue #3: Inline Date Formatting on Every Render

**Location:** `components/mirror/JournalHistory.tsx` lines 85-92

**Problem:**
Date formatting is performed inline during component render for every journal entry:

```typescript
{new Date(journal.created_at).toLocaleDateString('en-US', {
  year: 'numeric',
  month: 'long',
  day: 'numeric',
  hour: 'numeric',
  minute: '2-digit',
  hour12: true
})}
```

**Impact:**
- `toLocaleDateString()` with options is relatively expensive
- Re-computed on every render for every journal entry
- With 15+ journals, this compounds quickly

**Suggested Solution:**
Use `React.useMemo()` or pre-compute formatted dates:

```typescript
const formattedDate = React.useMemo(() => 
  new Date(journal.created_at).toLocaleDateString('en-US', {
    year: 'numeric',
    month: 'long',
    day: 'numeric',
    hour: 'numeric',
    minute: '2-digit',
    hour12: true
  }),
  [journal.created_at]
);
```

**Performance Gain:** Moderate - eliminates repeated expensive date formatting calls

## Issue #4: Set Recreation on Every Toggle

**Location:** `components/mirror/JournalHistory.tsx` lines 25-33

**Problem:**
Creates a new Set object every time a journal entry is expanded/collapsed:

```typescript
const toggleExpanded = (journalId: string) => {
  setExpandedEntries(prev => {
    const newSet = new Set(prev);  // Creates new Set every time
    if (newSet.has(journalId)) {
      newSet.delete(journalId);
    } else {
      newSet.add(journalId);
    }
    return newSet;
  });
};
```

**Impact:**
- Memory churn during frequent UI interactions
- Set allocation overhead on every toggle
- Minor but unnecessary

**Note:**
This is the standard React pattern for immutable state updates, but the memory allocation is still a consideration for frequently-used interactions.

**Suggested Solution:**
Consider using a simple object/Record instead of Set for better performance:

```typescript
const [expandedEntries, setExpandedEntries] = useState<Record<string, boolean>>({});

const toggleExpanded = (journalId: string) => {
  setExpandedEntries(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    [journalId]: !prev[journalId]
  }));
};
```

**Performance Gain:** Minor - reduces allocation overhead

## Issue #5: Inefficient Date Extraction in Mirror Grouping

**Location:** `app/(tabs)/mirror.tsx` lines 246-249

**Problem:**
Multiple array operations to find the most recent journal date:

```typescript
const dates = mirrorJournals
  .map(j => j.created_at ? new Date(j.created_at).getTime() : 0)
  .filter(time => time > 0);
const mirrorDate = dates.length > 0 ? Math.max(...dates) : Date.now();
```

**Impact:**
- Creates intermediate array with `.map()`
- Creates another intermediate array with `.filter()`
- Spreads potentially large array into `Math.max()`
- Three operations when one would suffice

**Suggested Solution:**
Use a single-pass `reduce()`:

```typescript
const mirrorDate = mirrorJournals.reduce((max, journal) => {
  if (!journal.created_at) return max;
  const time = new Date(journal.created_at).getTime();
  return time > max ? time : max;
}, 0) || Date.now();
```

**Performance Gain:** Moderate - eliminates intermediate arrays and reduces iterations

## Issue #6: Sequential AsyncStorage Operations

**Location:** `lib/supabase/auth.js` lines 96-106

**Problem:**
Two AsyncStorage remove operations are performed sequentially instead of in parallel:

```javascript
export const clearStoredAccessCode = async () => {
  try {
    await AsyncStorage.removeItem('starlight_current_user');
    await AsyncStorage.removeItem('starlight_access_code');
    // ...
  }
}
```

**Impact:**
- Slower sign-out operation
- Second operation waits for first to complete unnecessarily
- User perceives slower logout

**Suggested Solution:**
Use `Promise.all()` for parallel execution:

```javascript
export const clearStoredAccessCode = async () => {
  try {
    await Promise.all([
      AsyncStorage.removeItem('starlight_current_user'),
      AsyncStorage.removeItem('starlight_access_code')
    ]);
    // ...
  }
}
```

**Performance Gain:** Moderate - approximately 2x faster sign-out

## Issue #7: Array.from Usage in Progress Dots

**Location:** `components/mirror/MirrorViewer.tsx` line 71

**Problem:**
Uses `Array.from({ length: totalScreens })` which is less efficient than alternatives:

```typescript
{Array.from({ length: totalScreens }).map((_, index) => (
  <View key={index} style={...} />
))}
```

**Impact:** Minimal - minor performance difference

**Suggested Solution:**
Use simpler array creation:

```typescript
{[...Array(totalScreens)].map((_, index) => (
  <View key={index} style={...} />
))}
```

or

```typescript
{Array(totalScreens).fill(0).map((_, index) => (
  <View key={index} style={...} />
))}
```

**Performance Gain:** Minimal - slightly faster array creation
